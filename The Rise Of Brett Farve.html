		<p> Brett Farve grew up in rural Mississippi with a blue collar family who sought hard work to be the means to success. At a young age Brett saw success on the football field due to his heavily invested father who pushed him to extremes to be the best. Soon after highschool, he attended Souther Mississippi and started all four years. In the <a href="https://www.profootballhistory.com/brett-favre/">1991</a> NFL draft, Brett was selected 33rd overall by the Atlanta Falcons but was soon traded to the Packers for a first round pick the next year. As soon as Brett joined the Packers, he saw immediate success. During the years of 1995-1998, Brett led the packers to three straight NFC championship games which included two super bowl apperances and led to a super bowl win in 1996. As this was the only super bowl win in Farves long career, he was cemented as a football legend for the accolades he produced. By the end of 2007, he had passed Dan Marino as the leader in passing attempts, completions, yards and touchdowns. Farve was known as the iron man of the NFL because he never missed a game and would always deliever for his team when they needed him the most.</p>
