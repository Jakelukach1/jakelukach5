		<p> Although Brett Farve had a historic career with many different accolades, his sudden star power soon came to a halt. After the 2008 season which saw Brett having one of his most prolific years, the question was if he was going to retire. Brett soon announced that he was giving up on football and Aaron Rodgers would be named the starter for the Green Bay Packers. However, Brett came out of retirement and wanted to play for the Packers, but the orginization decided Rodgers was there starter, so he went to cross town rivals, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/546339-brett-favre-a-white-knights-fall-from-grace">The Minnesota Vikings</a>. Brett was upset at the packers for not offering him to stay and wanted to crush them at any chance he got. During his time on the Vikings, he sent suggestive text messages to Former Vikings employees, Farve was once the NFL golden boy and in a matter of years he lost everything. Recently, Farve has been connected to a welfare scandal in his hometown of Mississipi. In 2020 it came out that 94 million dollars of federal funds were to be given out to help the poverty riddled state, which was spent inappropiately, including embezzlement and fraud. In 2020, Farve was paid 1.1 million dollars for speaking about promotional engagements and autographs, but he never showed up to these events. The state of Mississipi is suing farve for the alleged 1.1 million and an extra 228,000 for the alleged fraud. Its difficult to see a hero fall into a villian in the span of a short 10 years. Farve will never be remembered for his legacy on the field but for how he handled himself off the field which is subpar.
